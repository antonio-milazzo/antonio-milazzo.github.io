# Antonio's C# Mini Portfolio
This site contains various projects I have worked on during my Programming class at Columbia College Chicago.

## Midterm Project
### Description:
A console line game

### Premise: 
In “The Lost Key to the Kingdom”, the player goes on a quest to try and find the lost key. In their quest, they encounter several villagers and must interact and trade with them in order to find the map that will lead the player to the key. But think wisely, each character will only trade for a specific item, so try and figure out who to trade with first

## Recursion Pot
### Description:
A console line project

### Premise: 
The program checks if a pot has reached it's minimum diameter, if it has then the it draws the lid and exits, and if it has not then it draws the current diameter then shrinks the diameter by 2/3. The program then calls itself again and loops until the minimum diameter, the lid, has been reached. Demostrating recursion.

## Adopt a Robot

### Description:
A console line project

### Premise:
Refractored Code for a game where the player adopts a robot and chooses the color of the robot.

## Final Project

### Description:
A WPF program

### Premise:
As a new recruit for a space force, you are assigned to collect data from different planets and talk to the lifeforms that inhabit those planets. But be careful, the lifeforms will get aggresive and attack! So make sure you have full health before returning to the command center with your data.
